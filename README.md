# CheckOutSimulator
This program simulates how a self checkout system works at your local grocery store. 
This program features a hardware folder which is meant to simulate hardware connection, a user interface, an attendant interface and another interface to interact with some of the maintainence an employee would do to the machines such as adding reciept paper. 


In order to simulate this software yourself clone download this repository, open the run.java file and populate the database with your own products.
